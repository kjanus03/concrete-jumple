**Concrete Jumple**

Concrete Jumple is a 2D platformer game built for speedrunning using JavaFX. Players control a monkey navigating a vertical tower of 100 randomly generated platforms. The goal is to complete the tower as quickly as possible while avoiding enemies and utilizing various buffs. The game also features a high score system that tracks the fastest completion times.
